    <h1>I am a long time coder</h1>

    <h2>My goal is to learn as much about coding as I possibly can</h2>

        <p>My name is Daniel Hoffmann. I started learning about programming when I was 13 years old. I like to learn
            about odd and unusual aspects of coding, like declaritive programming languages. The <a
                    href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programming language is one of my more preferred
            programming languages.</p>

        <p>When I code, I prefer to be as modular and upgradable as I possibly can. I will sometimes spend a couple days
            reworking some code until I can easily add things to it and change things easily. I quite like <a
                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming">Data-Driven Programming</a>, but I am
            not that good at the text parsing generally required for it.</p>

        <p>A lot of the coding that I have studied so far relates to making video games. I don't seem to have enough
            motivation to actually manage to get them to a playable state. I generally spend more time getting
            everything made in a flexible manner over completing the game and getting into the playable part.</p>

        <p>I am interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing">Parallel computing</a> and want
            to learn more about how to connect systems together for such a thing. I would like to make a fault-tolerant
            system in place with enough speed for real-time execution. An online game that got faster with more people
            connected would be a good proof-of-concept.</p>

        <p>Invent You Own Computer Games with Python is one of the best starting books on programming that I have found.
            It teaches how to use the various parts of programming with many little games like tic-tac-toe. In addition,
            it also teaches some basics of how a game works like the event loop, and basic AI.</p>

        <p>Game Coding Complete is one of the best books I have found for coding a full game from start to end. It has a
            lot of information for the connecting of the various parts of a game together, unlike most other books which
            give information on the pieces of a game, but do not give out information on how they communicate.</p>
