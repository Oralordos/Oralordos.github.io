            <p>My name is Daniel Hoffmann. I started learning about programming when I was 13 years old. I like to learn about odd and unusual aspects of coding, like declaritive programming languages. The <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> programming language is one of my more preferred programming languages.</p>
            <p>When I code, I prefer to be as modular and upgradable as I possibly can. I will sometimes spend a couple days reworking some code until I can easily add things to it and change things easily. I quite like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming">Data-Driven Programming</a>, but I am not that good at the text parsing generally required for it.</p>
