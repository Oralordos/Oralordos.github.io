           <p>I’m the founder at <a href="http://makerbased.com/" target="_blank">Maker Based Education</a> where we’re working to help schools bridge the gap between what students should be and are learning. I have a dream that one day every student will have the chance to learn skills (both hard and soft) that will equip them to be powerful in the real world.</p>

           <p>I’m also the Online Director at <a href="http://miles2give.org/" target="_blank">Miles 2 Give</a> where we run across and around countries (10,000+ miles around the US this year) to help raise money for Sarcoma cancer research.</p>

           <p>You can find my short writings on <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbonhardt">twitter here</a>. I write and contribute mainly at <a href="http://makerbasedblog.com/">Maker Based Blog</a> where you can learn skills to help you kick ass in today’s marketplace and of course plenty of learning hacks. Sometimes <a href="https://medium.com/@ryanbonhardt">I write on Medium</a> about whatever gets me excited, mainly educational reform and policy.</p>
