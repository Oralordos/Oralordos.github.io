        <p>Invent You Own Computer Games with Python is one of the best starting books on programming that I have found.
            It teaches how to use the various parts of programming with many little games like tic-tac-toe. In addition,
            it also teaches some basics of how a game works like the event loop, and basic AI.</p>

        <p>Game Coding Complete is one of the best books I have found for coding a full game from start to end. It has a
            lot of information for the connecting of the various parts of a game together, unlike most other books which
            give information on the pieces of a game, but do not give out information on how they communicate.</p>
